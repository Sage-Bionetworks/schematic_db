# Schematic DB

This package is used to manage backends in the FAIR data flow.

It is assumed that manifests are stored in a project at [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/),
 and have been validated via [Schematic](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic),
 or the [data curator app](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/dcamodules).

Schematic_db makes use of the schematic API which is not currently public yet.
To setup the API instructions are [here.](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/tree/develop/api)

Documentation of all classes are [here.](https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/schematic_db/)
