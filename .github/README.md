# Schematic DB

This package is used to manage backends in the FAIR data flow.

Currently relational databases are supported using the [RDB class.](https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/schematic_db/rdb/rdb.html)

The RDB class can pull manifests from a Synapse project, create a MySQL database, and store queries in a Synapse Project.

Documentation of all classes are [here.](https://sage-bionetworks.github.io/schematic_db/)
